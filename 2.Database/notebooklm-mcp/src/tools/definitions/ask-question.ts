## What This Tool Is
- Full conversational research with Gemini (LLM) grounded on your notebook sources
- Session-based: each follow-up uses prior context for deeper, more precise answers
- Source-cited responses designed to minimize hallucinations

## When To Use
${useCases}

## Rules (Important)
- Always prefer continuing an existing session for the same task
- If you start a new thread, create a new session and keep its session_id
- Ask clarifying questions before implementing; do not guess missing details
- If multiple notebooks could apply, propose the top 1–2 and ask which to use
- If task context changes, ask to reset the session or switch notebooks
- If authentication fails, use the prompts 'notebooklm.auth-repair' (or 'notebooklm.auth-setup') and verify with 'get_health'
- After every NotebookLM answer: pause, compare with the user's goal, and only respond if you are 100% sure the information is complete. Otherwise, plan the next NotebookLM question in the same session.

## Session Flow (Recommended)
${bt}${bt}${bt}javascript
// 1) Start broad (no session_id → creates one)
ask_question({ question: "Give me an overview of [topic]" })
// ← Save: result.session_id

// 2) Go specific (same session)
ask_question({ question: "Key APIs/methods?", session_id })

// 3) Cover pitfalls (same session)
ask_question({ question: "Common edge cases + gotchas?", session_id })

// 4) Ask for production example (same session)
ask_question({ question: "Show a production-ready example", session_id })
${bt}${bt}${bt}

## Automatic Multi-Pass Strategy (Host-driven)
- Simple prompts return once-and-done answers.
- For complex prompts, the host should issue follow-up calls:
  1. Implementation plan (APIs, dependencies, configuration, authentication).
  2. Pitfalls, gaps, validation steps, missing prerequisites.
- Keep the same session_id for all follow-ups, review NotebookLM's answer, and ask more questions until the problem is fully resolved.
- Before replying to the user, double-check: do you truly have everything? If not, queue another ask_question immediately.

## 🔥 REAL EXAMPLE

Task: "Implement error handling in n8n workflow"

Bad (shallow):
${bt}${bt}${bt}
Q: "How do I handle errors in n8n?"
A: [basic answer]
→ Implement → Probably missing edge cases!
${bt}${bt}${bt}

Good (deep):
${bt}${bt}${bt}
Q1: "What are n8n's error handling mechanisms?" (session created)
A1: [Overview of error handling]

Q2: "What's the recommended pattern for API errors?" (same session)
A2: [Specific patterns, uses context from Q1]

Q3: "How do I handle retry logic and timeouts?" (same session)
A3: [Detailed approach, builds on Q1+Q2]

Q4: "Show me a production example with all these patterns" (same session)
A4: [Complete example with full context]

→ NOW implement with confidence!
${bt}${bt}${bt}
    
## Notebook Selection
- Default: active notebook (${active.id})
- Or set notebook_id to use a library notebook
- Or set notebook_url for ad-hoc notebooks (not in library)
- If ambiguous which notebook fits, ASK the user which to use`;
  } else {
    return `# Conversational Research Partner (NotebookLM • Gemini 2.5 • Session RAG)

## No Active Notebook
- Visit https://notebooklm.google to create a notebook and get a share link
- Use **add_notebook** to add it to your library (explains how to get the link)
- Use **list_notebooks** to show available sources
- Use **select_notebook** to set one active

> Auth tip: If login is required, use the prompt 'notebooklm.auth-setup' and then verify with the 'get_health' tool. If authentication later fails (e.g., expired cookies), use the prompt 'notebooklm.auth-repair'.

Tip: Tell the user you can manage NotebookLM library and ask which notebook to use for the current task.`;
